# Background Context

In this project, you will learn about different caching algorithms.

## Resources

Read or watch the following resources:

- [Cache replacement policies - FIFO](link_to_resource)
- [Cache replacement policies - LIFO](link_to_resource)
- [Cache replacement policies - LRU](link_to_resource)
- [Cache replacement policies - MRU](link_to_resource)
- [Cache replacement policies - LFU](link_to_resource)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following concepts to anyone without using Google:

### General

- What a caching system is
- What FIFO means (First-In, First-Out)
- What LIFO means (Last-In, First-Out)
- What LRU means (Least Recently Used)
- What MRU means (Most Recently Used)
- What LFU means (Least Frequently Used)
- The purpose of a caching system
- The limitations of a caching system

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- A documentation is not a simple word; itâ€™s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)
